# Participation: A Unity Project in GitHub

## Goal and Why are we doing this?

To integrate all we have learned with git, github, and version control with Unity. We need to be able to use these concepts with Unity in order to make games. Before we jump into our big game project, let's get comfortable with the basics of setting up a new unity project and having it use version control. 

## Instructions

### Creating the repo

First we need to set up a new repo. We have done this a few times. So it should be familiar.

I called my repo: `practice-unity-project-01`.

As usual, initialize your repo with a README.md file. But this will be the first time we use a `.gitignore`. I won't go into too much detail. You can read up on it more on your own, but basically this file is going to tell git to ***ignore*** a bunch of files in our project folder and not include them in the version history. Because of that, we will only keep track of more important stuff like our scripts. I think that is a good enough description to get us moving on for today.

git comes built in with some default `.gitignore` files. One of which is made for Unity. That is pretty convienient. So, we don't have to write one ourselves. But you could if you wanted. 

Select "Unity" from the drop down list for our `.gitignore` field. 

I'll still leave licence as NONE since this is just a simple learning exercise.
